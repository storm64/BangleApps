Alarms & Timers
===============

This app allows you to add/modify any alarms and timers.

It uses the [`sched` library](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/blob/master/apps/sched)
to handle the alarm scheduling in an efficient way that can work alongside other apps.

Settings
--------

- `Save on Back`: If set to `On` then the alarm/timer will be automatically saved when 
you touch the *Back* icon in the top left. You can go back without saving using the 
new *Cancel* entry. Default is `Off`.
- `Scheduler`: Open the [Scheduler settings](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/blob/master/apps/sched/README.md#global-settings)
